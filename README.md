## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of projects with brief descriptions.
### Exploratory-Data-Analysis-UK-Vaccination-Trends
**Description:** This project involves the analysis of the UK Vaccination dataset, focusing on trends, patterns, and insights related to vaccination progress across various regions. The goal is to understand how vaccination rates vary over time, identify key influencing factors, and present the results through meaningful visualizations.<br>
**Code:**<a href = "https://github.com/Deepikamurali07/Main/blob/main/Python/UK%20Vaccination%20Data%20Analysis/Report.ipynb">
  <code>Report.ipynb</code></a><br>
**Presentation:** <a href = "">
  <code>PDF static version</code></a> <a href = "">
  <code>PowerPoint PPTX dynamic version</code></a><br>
**Original dataset:** <a href = "https://github.com/Deepikamurali07/Main/blob/main/Python/UK%20Vaccination%20Data%20Analysis/UK_VaccinationsData.xlsx">
  <code>UK_VaccinationsData.xlsx</code></a><br>
**Skills:** Data Analysis, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, Trend Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Statistical Analysis, Data Insights.<br>
**Results:** An analysis of a dataset containing information about vaccinations was conducted. Some insights were found, visualized, and included in the presentation.
### Second-Hand-Car-Market-Case-Study-Analysis-Report
**Description:** This project involved conducting an in-depth analysis of the second-hand car market in the UK, specifically focusing on BMW 3 Series cars in the BR2 0AA postal area. The objective was to identify key factors influencing the price of second-hand cars, with an emphasis on mileage and year of registration, using statistical modeling to forecast price trends.<br>
**Reports and conclusions:** <a href = "https://github.com/Deepikamurali07/Main/blob/main/Python/Second%20Hand%20Car%20Analysis/Data_mining_v0.2.ipynb">
  <code>Data Analyis.ipynb</code></a> <br>
**Original dataset:** <a href = "https://github.com/Deepikamurali07/Main/blob/main/Python/Second%20Hand%20Car%20Analysis/cleaned_data_new.xlsx">
  <code>cleaned-new-data.xlsx</code></a><br>
**Skills:** Data Collection & Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, Python, IBM SPSS Statistics, Data Visualization, Market Research, Reporting & Analysis, Problem-Solving & Critical Thinking.<br>
**Hard skills:** Excel, Pivot Tables, Formulas, Functions, Charts, Dashboards, Slices, Pivot Charts.<br>
**Results:** The analysis provided valuable insights into the pricing dynamics of second-hand BMW 3 Series cars, highlighting key price determinants and offering strategies to enhance predictive accuracy. The project delivered actionable insights that can help buyers, sellers, and market analysts better understand pricing trends in the second-hand car market. 
### Predictive-Analysis-for-Insurance-Risk-Assessment
**Description:** The main goals of this project are: <br> 1) To clean the dataset from Kaggle about real estate in the United States using SQL, <br>2) Explore data in Bigquery, <br> 3) Group and prepare data for visualization in Power BI, <br> 4) Create comprehensive dashboards, including interactive property stats, the price calculator that can count average prices by given parameters, and a dashboard that shows the quantity of sold properties in different states and the sales distribution among the months in the year for effective data exploration. <br>
**Data cleaning and exploring SQL:**<a href = "">

  <code>data_exploration.sql</code></a><br> 
**Power BI dashboards:** <a href = "">
  <code>real-estate-dashboards.pbix</code></a> <a href = "">
  <code>real-estate-dashboards.pdf</code></a><br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data vizualization<br>
**Hard skills:** Bigquery SQL, Power BI, Dashboards <br>
**Results:** Data was cleaned (which reduced the amount of data by about nine times), explored in Bigquery, imported into Power BI, transformed, and 3 dashboards were created.
### Time-Forecasting-&-Statistical-Modeling
**Repository:** <a href = "">
  <code>python-data-analysis</code></a> <br> 
**Description:** This repository contains ipynb files with tasks that were completed during the Python Data Analysis course on LinkedIn Learning. The main goal is to improve Python's analytical abilities. <br>
